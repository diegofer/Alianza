Description: line_profiler will profile the time individual lines of code take to execute.
        The profiler is implemented in C via Cython in order to reduce the overhead of
        profiling.
        
        Also included is the script kernprof.py which can be used to conveniently
        profile Python applications and scripts either with line_profiler or with the
        function-level profiling tools in the Python standard library.
